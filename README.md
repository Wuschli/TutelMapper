## Development
### Getting Started
Tutel Mapper is mainly based on Uno Platform ([Uno Platform Get Started](https://platform.uno/docs/articles/get-started.html)) and Skia Sharp ([Skia Sharp on GitHub](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp)).
The easiest way to gettings started on Tutel Mapper development is to open the _TutelMapper.sln_ file in Visual Studio after setting up the Uno Environment. Then select either the UWP or WASM (for now) project as the start-up project and have a look at the _EditorPage.xaml_.
